\section{Memory access}
 This custom DLX uses a Von Neumann architecture with data and instructions on the same physical memory.
 
 All memory accesses are aligned, meaning that fetching a half-word requires 1 less address bit than fetching a byte
 (as the LSB is forced to 0 and can be hardwired to ground somewhere else). Still, since the spare bit would be unused
 and additional hardware would be required to pass a different number of bits to the memory access unit, it was decided
 that this property would not be exploited.
 
 Fetched data are stored in a data cache, while instructions are stored in a separated instruction cache thus
 virtualizing a Harvard architecture.
 
 The architecture is big endian with 32-bit registers: operations work on full 32 bits even if the operands would
 require less. Loading a smaller operand will result in sign extension to get its size to 32 bits.
